## ~>  [Read questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

Everyday I get lots of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

### ~> Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).
- Be civil and polite.
